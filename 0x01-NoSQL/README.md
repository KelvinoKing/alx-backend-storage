## Project Overview
The project involves working with MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to understand its concepts, differences from SQL databases, and practical usage. It includes developing Python scripts to interact with MongoDB collections, performing various operations such as database creation, document insertion, deletion, updating documents, querying, and more.

## Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this project, learners are expected to understand and demonstrate the following concepts without external assistance:
- Understanding of NoSQL databases and their types
- Differentiating between SQL and NoSQL databases
- Understanding ACID properties
- Knowledge of document storage
- Benefits of using a NoSQL database
- Querying information from a NoSQL database
- Inserting, updating, and deleting information from a NoSQL database
- Utilizing MongoDB for database operations
- Writing Python scripts to interact with MongoDB collections using PyMongo

## Requirements
### MongoDB Command File
- All files should be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using MongoDB (version 4.2)
- Files should end with a newline
- The first line of all files should be a comment: `// my comment`
- A README.md file is mandatory at the root of the project folder
- File lengths will be tested using `wc`

### Python Scripts
- All files should be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7) and PyMongo (version 3.10)
- Files should end with a newline
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A README.md file is mandatory at the root of the project folder
- Code should adhere to the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5.*)
- File lengths will be tested using `wc`
- All modules and functions should have appropriate documentation
- Code should not be executed when imported (`if __name__ == "__main__":`)

### Setup
- MongoDB 4.2 can be installed on Ubuntu 18.04 following the official installation guide.
- PyMongo (version 3.10) can be installed using pip: `pip3 install pymongo`

## Tasks
The project consists of several tasks, each requiring the development of a Python script to perform specific operations on MongoDB collections. Tasks include creating databases, inserting documents, updating documents, deleting documents, and more.

For detailed information on each task and its requirements, refer to the project's directory `0x01-NoSQL`.
